# Installation steps

This README is a top level readme that just shows the order in which you should install the OpenShift environment.

* We must first configure an OpenShift environment.  If you do not have a cloud environment then you will need to do a bare-metal installation.  For bare-metal installation please see the README.md under the bare-metal directory for configuring openshift manually.

* Next, configure and install ElasticSearch Opendistro found under the opendistro drectory.
