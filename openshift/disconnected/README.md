# Syncronizing Repos for Disconnected Installation

For disconnected installations we need to synchronize RPM repos and download all images for the containers that will be running in the OpenShift environment.  We have created a directory that called repo-sync that will manage synchronizing the RPMs required for the OpenShift Origin 3.11 installation.

* Synchronize RPMs [README.md](./repo-sync/README.md)
* Comming soon, download all Images required for OpenShift origin 3.11.
